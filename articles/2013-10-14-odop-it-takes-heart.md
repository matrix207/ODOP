### It takes Heart 

Work. Life. eHarmony.

I earned the nickname "Love Doctor" in high school (among others).

For whatever reason, I took it upon myself to break down the problems of young love and give friend and foe ( it was high school, after all) important advice on love, relationships, and life at large.

I had no idea what I was talking about. **My own life was a mess.** 

At one point, my parents shared some 7-8 jobs. We moved every year or two. My friends, and my happiness, would come and go just at fast. After the divorce, my dad basically disappeared. My sister and I stayed with my Ma. She worked her ass off to try to provide for us, but this was in Southern Illinois. Her options: factory work or factory work. 

My uncle, who was like a brother to me growing up -- sharing my bunk, showing me music, motorcycles, Michael Jackson -- disappeared too.

My Ma's health eventually began to fail -- from stress, apparently. She suffered from two near-strokes in her early 30s, and it continues to get worse. She had another surgery this morning, actually...

It takes heart to be the **"Man of the House" before being a teenager.

As her life started to crumble around her, I guess mine did too. Instead of playing basketball or riding my blke with friends, I locked myself in my bedroom and tried to figure out what I could do to help. That was about the last time I remember experiencing true joy or carefreeness. 

After a few years -- having moved 3-4 more times, including about six months withou a home -- I needed a change of my own. I decide to move in with my dad. By this time, I had fallen into punk rock, and the scene was purportedly raging where he lived. So I followed the music.

**@MayorRock was born.** (Actually, it was @sicks back then, but we'll get to that in a bit.)

One day, a cop dropped me off at my dad's place aroud 6am. I walked through the door with my DUI ticked in hand. I turned 16 not even two weeks before. My dad, in a hurry to get to work, noticed my car wasn't in the yard and offered to give me a ride to pick it up. He dropped me off where the cop had pulled me over about an hour earlier. He didn't give me a lecture.  He didn't say anything, really. He did give me $20 for gas and  told me to be careful driving home. Take the backroads.

**I was still very drunk. ** And 16.

I can't call my dad, Dad. I've legally changed my name to separate myself from him -- that's why I only have one name, in case you're wondering... He was never a dad. He was a creep, a thief, a cheat, a liar. The few "quallity" father-son times I remember as a kid were shattered in my 20s when I verified that he would use me -- this cute blonde kid whose mommy wasn't around (she was) -- to cheat on my Ma. Often. With me in the other room. Waiting. Listening. All right.

Now that my Ma lived an hour away, it started to strain my patience. I can't remember how many times I had to drive 100mph+ through the backroads of Southern Illinois just to find out she just had to fart or something. There was always a false alarm of some kind. Wolf. Wolf.

My sister and I didn't get along. The stress from the divorce drove us apart when we probably needed each other the more than anyone else. I thought she needed to grow up -- do her own thing -- instead of relying on our deadbeat dad. I didn't know something bad  had happened to her. I was probably ten years old the last time I told her I loved her.

An aside: at my sister's wedding, my Aunt asked me when I was going to get married. I asked if she was joking. **Everyong** in my family had been divorced. Even her -- although she did remarry the same guy. my aunt would later email me to apologize for not thinking about how their divorce could have impacted my life at a distance. It didn't. At all. She was a psychotic religious cunt growing up. But I was happy that she reached out.

My sister finalized her divorce earlier this year. I digress...

This was about the extend of the Love Doctor's experience with love.

But where I lacked love, I gained maturity. I built a brand. I understood social currency. Behavior. Manipulation. I had plenty of book smarts, but I had developed a ton of street smarts for someone that did'nt grow up in a metropolitan ghetto. I was a vegetarian. I fought for equality -- in rural Illinois, where I grew up with a grandpa that would brag about rigging people's (black people's) parachutes not to open during the War.

My dad's lack of fathering allowed me to find my own path -- something 

I probable wouldn't have done otherwise. I often skipped school. Hosted parties. Midget porn parties (long story). Loundly. All night.

I claimed my emancipation. **I used him back.**

It would have been easy to become a drug addict. However, I became addicted to computers and conversations over keys. Instead of skipping school to get high or cause trouble, I found Mt. Dew. BBS. TCP. IRC.

My mask became a screen and a handle. I became known as @sicks.

I had seen what alcohol did to my family. I had two alcoholic grandpas: one dead, one soulless. My parents never drank though. I wonder why. My drummer was one of the most talented drummers in the world, but drank a gallon of Jack every day. He was sad. Now, sadly, he's dead.

I only went to school to socialize and take the required tests. I aced them, but graduated in the bottom three -- below the Special Ed kids -- because of my poor attendance and not returning homework. I didn't need to go to school or do my homework. It was pointless.

Life is ironic like that. Maybe mine more than others.

By the time I was 15, I worked on the * Board of Association of Illinois High Schools,** the ** Board of the Chamber of Commerce,** helped develop computer facilities at the high school and community college, co-ran security for an ISP, worked at the NCSA, and took college-level classes in architecture, literature, and CompSci. I even learned COBOL.

My high school nearly flunked me. **I am now their biggest success.**

My best friend and first co-founder died soon after graduation. I was 18 and ill-equipped to deal with  a loss that actually mattered to me. I cried for the first time. I cried for weeks. Uncontrollable. Not just for him.

My childhood conditioned me to thrive on pain and challenges.

Now I sit here, almost twenty years later, blogging...for the first time, trying to figure out how to weave an open telling of my childhood, entrepreneurship, and what I've learned from a broken heart (literally and figuratively), in hopes of , maybe, earning back my love Doctor title.

Before moving to LA in january, I was dying. **I moved to LA to die.**
