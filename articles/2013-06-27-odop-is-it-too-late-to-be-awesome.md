The dangers of comparing, perfectionism and being too hard on ourselves.

I was taking with a friend today about all the different blogs, websites and people that I follow online. He was amazed that I rattled off all of these website with ease without having to really look anything up. I have been trying to find a place to house all of the awesomeness that I find on a daily basis.

"That way, I can share with you the journey of my findings in real time", I joked.

As I was showing him foundation.kr (started by Kevin Rose, founder of Digg and other awesome sites), I started to feel by looking at Kevin's list of investments, companies he founded and other achievements that I haven't really **done** anything with my life. Now... if you ask those around me, they would definitely beg to differ. I'll spare you the details of my life that will only result in a embarrasing need rof validation, but as I started to look at his list, and at mine, I came to a couple conclusions:

1. I need to do more.

2. I need to forget about #1, and realize that I just want to do more, and desire a certain level of success that could come if I just focused more.

3. I need to not be so hard on myself with #1 and #2, and breathe.

4. Life can be happen in the blink of an eye, no matter what age, so create the habit to build mometum.

5. There is a danger in comparison.

I had to actually take a step back from the dark road I was about to go down> I looked at my life and thought about all the things I could have accomplished as a kid that has had a computer since 1987. What was in my way? Why didn't I achieve more? What was wrong with me?

The answer was simply this. I have been in my own way by creating a high standard by which I compared myself, measured myself and then downed myself all because I felt I had to be something more. Something greater. Someone other than.. well, me. There is a danger in never talking time to celebrate the small (or large) victories.

So what's the point in all of this? I think the point is in learning how to simply just be. It's difficult and I believe it takes a lifetime to master. Comparing is as much of a disease as perfection. When we learn to be ourselves, be patient, and how to be comfortable in our own skin, then - and only then - will we achieve true happiness.
