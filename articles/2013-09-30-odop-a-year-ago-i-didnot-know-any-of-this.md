##A year ago, I didn't know any of this 

Things I learned while building my first startup

It's been the most interesting time of my life. For what it's worth, here's what I think  I learned in a year of building a venture-backed statup with 15 amazing people and a product used by companies all over the world.

###Cheating product research

Making a good product is hard. You can't fly by instruments, because at first, there aren't any. You can get a basic sense of direction by building something you'd use yourself. This way you already have some idea of what's missing and what would be awesome to have. Our major de-risking trick was to build something that we knew at least one person would buy: ouselves. I know it sounds like chickening out of product research, but hey, startups are hard so I'll use any unfair advantage I have.

###Far-sightedness versus near-sightedness

I was disppointed to find out that customers don't buy visions and frankly they don't give a damn for your revolutionary ideas about software. They buy things that work today, meaning features and immediate result. So you must take small steps along the path customers carve for you if you want to be relevant. But you can't let them lead you completely, you still need to see far ahead and nudge everything towards a destination that exists only in your head. This is a hard, schizophrenic, mind-bending design process. One of the hardest things in my life today is the constant choice between being far-sighted for one thing and near-sighted for the other.

###Growth versus optimisation

The geek inside me wants to optimise. It's a comfortable space. Have something, tweak it to make it better. Be smug about it. When that something is 100 signups, best spend your time getting another 100, instead of improving conversion by 0.5%. In the beginning, growth is the only thing that matters.

###Focus

Measure everything. You never know when it'll come handy. But it's easy to fall into the nerby trap of trying to interpret everything to soon, and improve every single metric. This isn't helpful. Find out the one thing, the one metric, that impacts your growth the most and throw all your weight on it. Every three months, re-evaluate what is the one thing that matters most. With all your team. Features, marketing, time, every single person in the team pushing the biggest lever for growth. You're not stong enough yet to be pushing two levers at once.

###Actual customers
