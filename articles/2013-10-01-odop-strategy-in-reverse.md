###Strategy, in reverse

Why the typical strategy process wastes too much time.

Our current strategy process follows an old-school waterfall. We can't develop ideas until we have a strategy. And we can't write strategy until we have insights. And we don't have insights until we immerse ourselves in the landscape.

The sad truth: the executable ideas are the most important thing. It's what the client cares about most.

Yet, for every single Undercurrent project, I'd wish we spent more time on the ideas and less on preparation. For an 8-week project, we don't begin addressing executable ideas until the final week.
