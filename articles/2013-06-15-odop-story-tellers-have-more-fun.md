"Great stories happen to those who can tell them."--Ira glass

We all want to be interesting people. We want people to listen to us, to like us. We want them to date us, hire us, elect us, acquit us. We want influence.

Too bad we're so inherently uninteresting. School, kids, bills...No time for chance meeting with eccentric strangers or revelations of the beauty of nature. No time for adventure.

Yet, if we look at the interesting people in our lives, I think we'll find few of them have climbed Mount Everest or broken a wild mustang. Most have never wrestled an alligator or gotten embroiled in a covert operation. Most haven't seen a whole lot of real excitement.

So, what makes them so compelling?

Interesting people often lead surprisingly ordinary lives, but they are not ordinary. What sets them apart is their ability to tell a good story.

## A show about nothing.

In the Seinfeld episode, 'The Pitch', Jerry is approached by a NBC executive and invited to pitch a sitcom to the network. Jerry and George are at Monks trying to come up with something, when they come up with nothing, instead.

>> JERRY: So, we go to NBC, we tell them we've got an diea for a show about nothing.
>>
>> GEORGE: Exactly.
>>
>> JERRY: They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
>>
>> GEORGE: There you go.
>>
>> JERRY: I think you may have something there.

Seinfel was a show about nothing. Nothing is really about nothing, of course. Stuff happens--riding in a cab, waiting in line, watching a movie, going on a date. But, these mundane situations were viewed through a lens that's slightly warped and exaggerated.

Jerry Seinfeld has built his career as comedian finding humor in vacuum cleaners and cereal boxes. He knows how to tell a good story, no matter what the subject matter.

## The tale is in the telling.

Everyday storytellers weave the ordinary and spectacular into a larger narrative and invite us to follow along. Like a good stand-up comic, they've trained their eyes and ears to find meaning and humor in life--the inconsistencies, eccentricities, and injustices that make up our world--and to convey those observations in a way that helps us make new discoveries ourselves.

Andrew Stanton, the writer of Toy Story and Wall-E, said this in a recent Ted talk:

>> "Storytelling is joke telling. It's knowing your punchline, your ending. Knowing that everything you're saying from the first sentence to the last is leading to a singular goal and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understanding of who we are as human beings."

## Social storytelling.

For many, social media began as a way to share what you were having for lunch. I'm eating a sandwich. This pizza is really good. Wish I had some ice cream (frowny face). Nobody really care about your food, but the potential was there.

The most successful Twitter accounts are the ones that inform, entertain, and provoke conversation. 140 characters is plenty of space to communicate something valuable to your followers, whether from you daily life or another source.

Take Teju Cole's Twitter series, 'Small Fates', where he told stories of everyday people--usually meeting untimely end--found in international newspapers:

Reading Cole's Twitter feed during the Small Fates project was almost hypnotic. Peeking into these otherwise insignificance lives, often from across the world or decades in the past, was powerful.

Twitter's a great place to hone your storytelling skill. Not that it's easy to say something interesting in 140 characters--it's not. Writing concisely is a challenge. But, on Twitter, you have the advantage of immediate feedback. When your tweets hit the mark your followers will favorite, retweet, and replay. Eventually, they'll increase.

(There's a lot of advice out there for growing your Twitter followers and increasing your online influence, but it will always fall flat in you have nothing interesting to say.)

Telling stories in community is a beautiful thing. When I post something on Facebook I'm inviting comments, debate, and collaboration. Anecdotes are more entertaining when your friends or followers add their ouw perspective. It's how storis grow and communities from.


## Brand storytelling.

Brands want to be interesting, too. They need to be interesting. This is accomplished the same way form brands as it is for individuals: by telling good stories.

Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS, has said that customers don't buy shoes from TOMS, the buy a story. Customers connect with the company's mission--donating a pair of shoes for every pair sold--and want to participate.

Not every company has roots in social good, but every company has something to say. Every company is made up of intersting people with vision and creativity, encounters challenges, and deals with success/failure. There are stories there that people can connect with.

##Stories need to be told.

Anyone can tell a story, so figure out what you have to say and find your voice. Watch for coincidence, oddity, and surprise. If you havd kids, listen to them. Kids are my favorite source for insight. They see the world without the baggage of years, and without context and information adults take for granted.

Think about what you bring to the table. What interesting your? What excite your? Share those things and you'll find that there are others who want to listen.

You can go swim the English Channel or break the world record for juggling while walking backwards (there's a guy who holds that record and I know him). But, even experiences as unavoidably interesting as these still need to be communicated. You still need to convince people to care.

That's what makes an interesting person interesting, and what makes everyday storytelling so important.
