Mothertime

Becoming a parent means having less time. Just what a melancholy Russian likes to hear 

As a reluctant owner of a Great Russian Soul, I had always been insterested in time. Nothing gave me more pleasure than ruminating over its passage. It made me susceptible to lachrymose movies like Beaches, time travel narratives, melancholy European novels. Since the age of ten, I wrote letters to myself to be opened in ten years, produced recording of my voice to listen to in some distant future, and later, in college, shot video of my roommates on the cusp of graduation. At first they would never experience together again. But after a while they got fed up with my intoning, "This is the last time we will ever..." or "in twenty years, when we are old, we will look back on this night."

"Shut up already," they said. "You're just walllowing."

And it was true. Watching this video did not contain in it even a quarter of the pleasure of making it. Of the bittersweet gratification of capturing time, with the knowledge that it would soon escape the grasp.

Almost twenty years later, when I was getting ready to become a mother, I found myself mourning the end of my pre-mother days in the same theatrical way. I would bid adieu to small acts of freedom. The finalities I noted: the last time my parents, my husband and I would watch movies at their house deep into the night, the last vacation to Turks and Caicos with my husband where I forced us to go out even if we were too tired ("Soon we won't have a choice!"), my last time -- at least for a long while -- at a writers' residency where I basked in solitude and emerged with practically no new work. Instead, I meandered through the woods, thinking, Goodbye, this life.
