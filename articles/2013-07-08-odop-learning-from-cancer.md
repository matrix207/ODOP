Because we all have cancer, maybe.

I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma in 2008 when I was in my mid-20s. Yes, carcinoma means cancer. I had the left lobe of my thyroid removed. It was a very small tumor that was discovered during a regular check-up. I didn't even need iodine / chemo therapy after and I got to keep my right lobe.

My body continues to function with just half of the thyroid. I have been in cancer remission for years now and don't think I will die of thyroid cancer any time soon.

My doctor said, if one can pick a cancer to have, this would be it. Low malignant and slow-growing. Depending on source, the overall 5-year survival rate for papillary thyroid cancer is 96% or 97%, with a 10-year survival rate of 93%. ([wikipedia says so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer).)

**Simply put, my probalitity of dying in a car crash is probably about them same as dying of thyroid cancer.**

Some people might think that this is a very personal story to share. However, I have learned so much from my cancer, and I want to share them. It has brought so much light into my life, and given me so much strength, awareness, and empathy.

And here are some things that I have learned, that are applied to many aspects of life, except for battling cancer:

-----

##You have so much to give 
After my surgery, the doctors told me that I wouldn't need iodine nor chemo therapy. That was the moment I realized that I didn't need to lose my long hair. Honestly, I was ready to say goodbye to my long ponytail.

I thought it was a great opportunity for me to donate my hair. **I was so lucky to have my life, why not give some of it away?**

I took a photo of my long locks and then had it cut off. I donated it to [locks of love](http://www.locksoflove.org/), a public non-profit organization that provides hairpieces to children in the United States and Canada suffering from long-term medical hair loss from any diagnosis.

**So give some of that good energy of your life away. You have so much of it. Giving feels great.**

##The small things matter more 

Cancer remission is not a nice place to be. For more people it's a physical scare, for me, it's more of a mental burden because of my very positivie prognosis.

I have to have yearly checkups. Series of blood tests, ultrasounc, and chest x-ray. Every time I do the checkup, I go through a short phase of doubt. It feels extremely powerless to not being able to trust your own body. 

It made me realize: **It sucks having to live with a disease.**

I have lost people to cancer before, and I have had cancer. But honestly, I think it's probably worse to have diabetic or other hereditary life-long problem. I can't imagine what a diabetic person has to go through on a day-today basis. Chronic diseases is in every fabric of life, physically and emotionally.

**Instead of only feeling bad for someone's big health problem, it's much nicer to care about the burdens one has to carry day-today.**

This even goes to the extend of emotional trauma or childhood nightmare. We see it in people everyday but we tend to turn a blind eye. No one needs pity, but it's nice to show people that you acknowledge the sadness behind their eyes.

##"Living in the moment" is total bullshit

We probably all have cancer. Cancer is a mutation of cells. I think that we probably all have that 1 bad cell floating around somewhere. It's kind of silly to say " I have to live in the moment" after having cancer. Why do we need such cliche epiphany moment in our lives to achieve greatness?

I have always lived fearlessly in my adult life per-cancer. My best takeaway from my cancer journey, is that I can now see the lightness in life. 

**It's not about being a daredevil, it's about bringing out the brightness in every moment.**

I am happier. I appreciate the little things in life more. I don't judge myself as much. It's about walking on the bright side of the street and looking at the good side of things. It's not about ruthless decision-making or "I have to try everything once." It's about being at peace with the moment you are in.

**Learn to live properly. There are no "moments" to be lived. You create those damn moments with your emotion.**

So here are what I learned from cancer, that I would like to share: 

+ Get a health check, your body deserves it.
+ Be nice to people. give something back to the world.
+ Regardless of your diseases and problem, just freaking live.

But if I were you, I'd stop spending so much time reading on the internet and go experience the world more. :)
