###Hot wo build great products

If you believe that [sales fix everything](http://www.defmacro.org/2013/07/23/startup-lessons.html), if follows that most startup fail because they don't ship a great product in a growing market before they run out of money. Assuming you've picked an explosive market, how do you go about building a great product?

Building great product is hard, but the difficulty is greatly exacerbated if you have no good model for analyzing products and features. withthou a model you're left with a never-ending stream of feature ideas and half-informed shots in the dark.
