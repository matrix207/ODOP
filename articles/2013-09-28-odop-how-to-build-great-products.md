###Hot wo build great products
26 Sep 2013

If you believe that [sales fix everything](http://www.defmacro.org/2013/07/23/startup-lessons.html), if follows that most startup fail because they don't ship a great product in a growing market before they run out of money. Assuming you've picked an explosive market, how do you go about building a great product?

Building great product is hard, but the difficulty is greatly exacerbated if you have no good model for analyzing products and features. withthou a model you're left with a never-ending stream of feature ideas and half-informed shots in the dark. Some people can pull this off because the start out with a phenomenal product intuition. But most people aren't blessed with this superpower on day one.

I started out with terrible intuition (and didn't know it). Over the past three years I looked at our user metrics every day, creating a feedback loop to train my brain on what makes a good product. Eventually I got quite good at predicting the impact of any given feature, so I started thinking of a model that capture the essence of what I've learned.

####The three bucket model

The most important aspect of product management is categorizing features into three buckets: gamechangers, showstoppers, and distractions. When I first started building products, all features looked roughtly the same. Over time, I formed the three bucket model and now my mind automatically slots every feature into one of these buckets. 

Here is an example. Suppose you are building a new mobile phone. It has to be able to call people, or no one will buy it since it wouldn't be much of phone. But the reverse isn't ture -- having voice calls won't make anybody buy your phone because every other phone already does that. So for your mobile phone product, voice calls are a showstopper.

On the other hand, suppose your phone could project videos onto a surface. No other phone odes that, so this feature could be a gamechanger that excites a lot of consumers. Alternatively, it's possible that most people won't care about it at all, in which case it's just a distraction.

This example give you three buckets to categorize any given feature:

* **A gamechanger.** People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
* **A showstopper.** People won't buy your product if you're missing this feature, but adding it won't generate demand.
* **A distraction.** This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.

Empirically, successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and every few features that are distractions. Your job is to build an intuition about your space to be able to tell these categories apart. That's still pretty subtle (is a built-in phone project a gamechanger or a distraction?), but at least this model gives you a plan of attack.

####Resource allocation 

If you had infinite time, you could ignore these categories and blindly iterate on the project untill it resonates with the market. But your time is finite. The longer you  take to find a great product, the more likely you are to run out of cash, squander morale, or miss the market moving under your feet. Modeling product management in terms of the three categories is extremely valuable because it allows you to treat product management as a resource allocation problem.

If you put any effort into distractions, you're wasting resources. That much is abvious.

If you're doing more showstopper feature than you absolutely need to, you're wasting resources. Lack of copy-pasting on the first iPhone might have been a showstopper for some people, but Apple correctly determined that enough consumers would still buy the phone. There was no need to delay.

If you put more effort into any giver showstopper thant the absolute minimum you can get away with, you're wasting resources. The first iPhone had pretty bad voice quality, but it was good enough. Most people were willing to live with it. It made calls, and it wasn't terrible. Improving the voice quality by another 10% would have made little measurable impact on adoption.

If you're doing more than three gamechanging features, you're wasting resources. Empirically, few disruptive products are good at a dozen things. Shipping gamechanging features is hard. Three is probably the most you can get away with, and even that is a stretch.

Finally, if you don't pour enough creative energy into any given gamechanging feature, you're wasting resources. If a gamechanging feature doesn't absolutely blow people away, it's not much of a gamechanger -- it's just a distraction. In this category you can't go half way.

You can get way with making some mistakes. Very few products absolutely nail this on launch. But more first time product managers break all oth these rules all the time, probably because they're not aware of them. Break these rules at your own peril. The fewer mistakes you make relative to your competition, the better. Every mistake can be incredibly costly. Make too many and someone else will run circles around you.

####Craftsmanship

THe trickiest part of buiding products is learning how to tell the difference between the categories and knowing when a give category is full. Is a built-in phone project a gamechanger or a distraction? If it's a gamechanger, is it big enough to attract sufficient demand, or do you need another gamechanger? If you invented the technology to increase voice quality by 50%, does that become a gamechanger or is it still just a showstopping feature? How about 200%? How many showstoppers do you have to neutralize to build a compelling phone?

I have no idea what the answers are for the mobile phone market, but in my area, unstructured data, I can look at any giver feature and tell which category it falls into quite easily. Sometimes I'm wrong, but that's ok. I just have to be wrong less often than my competiors.

The best way to build this intuition is to talk to a lot of people. Talk to potential users. What do they think? Talk to people who tried to build a product in your space and failed. What can you learn from their failure? Talk to competiors. How do they approach the problem? Talk to engineers in big companies. What can they tell you about the state of technology? Talk to other entrepreneurs in adjacent spaces, investors, journalists, grad students, professors, even the naysayers. The best way to get a sense of taste in a given space is to inject yourself into the industry and talk to as many people as you can.

####Buyers, stakeholders and pundits

The sooner you can learn about the history of the space, the state of the technology, the opinions of potential users, and the direction of your competition, the sooner you can form a coherent view of the space and develop a unique vision for you product. But be careful. It's easy to start taling advice from the wrong people.

Suppose you've decide to design your mobile phone in a form factor of a walkie takie for construction workers, and you've determined that the best way to sell it is to construction manager top-down. If you talk to construction workers, the might be enamored by beautiful icons and an unusual color scheme. You might determine that the unique design of your phone is a gamechanger. But utilmately, it's the construction manager who's writing the check. For the construction manager, a beautiful design is nice, but it isn't gamechanger. It doesn't help him run the business any better than he did before.

For complex business sales, you have to pay attention to all the parties and make sure all the stakeholders are satisfied. Are the construction worker strong influencers on the manager's decision? If so, spending time on a unique design might not be a bad idea. If not, you might be wasting your time.
